# CS577 Algorithms (Spring 2024)
This repository contains my assignments and resources related to COMP SCI 577 - Intro to Algorithms, offered at UW-Madison.

## Course Overview


- **Focus**: The course emphasizes fundamental paradigms for designing and analyzing efficient algorithms.
- **Topics Covered**:
  - **Greedy Algorithms**: Making locally optimal choices at each step with the hop of finding a global optimum. Selecting best available option without considering overall impact on solution
  - **Divide and Conquer**: Breaking down problems into smaller sub-problems, solving each sub-problem independently, and combining sub-solutions to obtain the overall solution
  - **Dynamic Programming**: Solving problems by breaking them into overlapping sub-problems and storing results of sub-problems to avoid redundant computations. Involves memoization/tabulation.
  - **Network Flow**: Deals with optimizing the flow of resources (data, goods, traffic) through a network graph by finding maximum flow or minimum cut in a network. Involves reducing problems into networks in order to run flow algorithms to obtain solutions.
  - **Intractability / NP-Completeness**: Refers to problems that are computationally difficult to solve efficiently. NP-Completeness is a class of problems for which no polynomial-time algorithm exists
  - **Randomness**: Algorithms that leverage randomness to solve problems. Randomness is used intentionally to improve efficiency.
