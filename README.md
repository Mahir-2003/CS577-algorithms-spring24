COMP SCI 577 - Intro to Algorithms, offered at UW-Madison

Focuses on the basic paradigms for the design and analysis of efficient algorithms: greedy, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, reductions, and the use of randomness. Computational intractability including typical NP-complete problems and ways to deal with them.

Greedy - Making locally optimal choices at each step with the hop of finding a global optimum. Selecting best available option without considering overall impact on solution
Divide and Conquer - Breaking down problems into smaller sub-problems, solving each sub-problem independently, and combining sub-solutions to obtain the overall solution
Dynamic Programming - Solving problems by breaking them into overlapping sub-problems and storing results of sub-problems to avoid redundant computations. Involves memoization/tabulation.
Network Flow - Deals with optimizing the flow of resources (data, goods, traffic) through a network graph by finding maximum flow or minimum cut in a network. Involves reducing problems into networks in order to run flow algorithms to obtain solutions.
Intractability / NP-Completeness - Refers to problems that are computationally difficult to solve efficiently. NP-Completeness is a class of problems for which no polynomial-time algorithm exists
Randomness - Algorithms that leverage randomness to solve problems. Randomness is used intentionally to improve efficiency.
